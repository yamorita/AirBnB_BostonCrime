# Problem Objective
AirBnB has revolutionized the hospitality industry by enabling travelers to find affordable and unique accommodation options in popular tourist destinations. However, the safety of the neighborhoods where AirBnB listings are located can have a significant relationship with consumer behavior, including pricing and ratings. By analyzing the relatioonship of criminal activity on the AirBnB listings in Boston, we will attempt to understand consumer behavior and how consumers react to sociological impacts.

The business problem is to understand if there is a correlation between the number of crimes committed in a particular area and what relationship that has with the number of bookings on AirBnB in that area. This can help AirBnB hosts in Boston to make informed decisions about the pricing and management of their listings based on the safety of the area. If safer areas of the city receive higher ratings and prices than unsafe areas, it could suggest that safety is an important consideration for AirBnB guests when choosing a location to stay. This information can be useful for AirBnB hosts, as well as for policymakers and city planners who are interested in promoting safe and 
attractive neighborhoods. 

# Report Summary
Throughout this notebook we looked at, cleaned, interpreted, and compared data from our AirBnb dataset and our Boston crime dataset, in order to understand the implications of crime on number of AirBnb bookings and therefore pricing based on location. We faced a lot of challenges throughout the process when it came to joining our data, understanding what data to use, and therefore interpreting data. In the end, we were able to review our data, and come to our consensus that there was correlation between crime and consumer behavior when it came to booking an AirBnb, and even a slight correlation between crime and AirBnb listing price.

# Data source
To analyze this problem, we will be using two datasets. The first dataset is the AirBnB data in Boston, which contains information about the AirBnB listings in Boston, such as location, price, availability, and other relevant details. The second dataset is the Criminal Activity in Boston, which contains information about criminal incidents reported in Boston from 2015 to 2022 and includes information on the type of crime, location, date, and time of occurrence, among other details.

# Motivation
Our group is interested in consumer behavior and how consumers react to sociological relationships. We also wanted to gain a better understanding on how predictable AirBnb bookings can be, when crime is taken into account, and if we could further predict AirBnb price depending on crime in the location of the listing.
